Hello, my name is Chris Ramos. I am interested in a few things, the main ones being astronomy, photography, and hiking.
I want to learn more about filtering data and being able to clean data to make it more separable. I think this course can help
me understand different data types and which are considered more beneficial than others. I have an idea for a project where I need to
make predictions based on historical data, and I think this course perfectly aligns with that. I'm not sure if I will be using an LLM to help make predictions
or if I will do probability from historical data, but data analysis will be very helpful for both.
