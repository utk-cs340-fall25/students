I'm currently a junior double major in **Honors: Mathematics and computer science**. My research interests in math include graph algorithms and existence/isolation results for Hadamard matrices. I learned to program with Python in high school during my free time, and enjoyed it enough to choose comp sci as my double major with math. I currently play table tennis for the university. I also enjoy dancing, tumbling, and running. I'm comfortable with C/C++, Rust, and JavaScript, and can get by using Python.

Over the summer, I learned JavaScript and was inspired by a friend playing a video game to try to make a web-based lava shader. The current results can be found [here](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~rlawren9/web-lava-demo). Currently, I'm on a numerical analysis depth track for math, but this project has made me consider taking MATH 523/524 and 527 to learn more about Brownian motion and stochastic modeling.
