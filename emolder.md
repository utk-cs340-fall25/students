## Basic Details
* Name: Ethan Molder.
* Preferred Name: William (middle name).
* netid: emolder.

## Background
When I originally enrolled at UT, I was majoring in aerospace engineering. However, I changed it when, during my COSC 101 class, I realized that I liked working with computers more than I liked AE. Despite the fact that I am majoring in computer science, my end goal is to go to law school and become a patent attorney (and to become a patent attorney you need a STEM degree). As to why, I believe my personality and skills are best suited for a career as a lawyer as I quite like reading, writing, and arguing with people.
## Interests
* Making 3D models and Dioramas.
* Mueseums. [My favorite](https://www.metmuseum.org/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22380952476&gbraid=0AAAAACr7WOlavar3YUYnrZ6JPyKkICQss&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwZDFBhCpARIsAB95qO3RMz9xUSdPYCXElhGgXbRxrMOFhGra6ON9-1mDY5AHxuyFPfb7N0oaAgVUEALw_wcB)
* Cooking and Baking.
* Reading. Particularly non-fiction.
* Learning new things in any field.
## Disinterests
* A.I. I like doing things myself and the practice is always beneficial.
## Skills
I am familiar with C++, C#, and find assembly languages easy to learn and use. I have some experience with Unity but I don't particularly like Unity or making video games.
