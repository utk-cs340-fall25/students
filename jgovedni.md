## About Me
I am a fifth-year senior from Los Angeles, CA. I came initially as a business major, switching into computer science during my sophomore year in college. I like computer vision in bioinformatics (especially sports) and am interested in AI business applications/opportunities. Outside academics, I enjoy weightlifting, baseball (go Mariners!), and music. I play piano and pipe organ, serving regionally as a substitute church organist. I most enjoy Renaissance motet music, with my favorite piece being Gesualdo's [Illumina_Faciem_Tuam]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcrRGDyqN64
