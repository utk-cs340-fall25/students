## Background
I grew up in Lake Villa, Illinois, which is a town about an hour north of Chicago. During that time I took a lot of challenging AP classes, but by far my favorite two were AP Computer Science and AP Music Theory, both of which heavily influenced my choice in majors. I have enjoyed playing video games for a long time, and one of the things I like most about them is the music. This influenced my career goal, which is to become a video game composer.
## Interests
I am interested in video games and most things relating to them. I enjoy playing video games, watching certain esports, developing video games, and writing video game music. I am also interested in board games, tabletop RPGs (such as Dungeons & Dragons), camping, and reading, with my favorite book series being the [Skyward Series](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/skyward-series) by Brandon Sanderson.
