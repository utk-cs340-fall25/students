Prior to being a student I served in the military for eight years. My wife and I moved back to
Tennessee in 2023, and I started at UT that fall. We just had our first child, Tucker, last spring.
I am very interested in comp sci. In my free time I mess around with a homelab server and arduinos. Also, my wife and I enjoy hiking in the smokies on the weekends. We normally use
[All Trails](https://www.alltrails.com/parks/us/tennessee/great-smoky-mountains-national-park) to find trails.

## Skills

This past summer I worked at Garmin as a SWE intern on a UI development team for their smart watches. At Garmin we used a full CI/CD pipeline.
Along with this, I used Gerrit (similar to GitHub), and an automated build system called Waf.
