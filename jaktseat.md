Hello! My name is Jake Seaton and I am in my final semester of my Master's degree. I have been a GTA for a few courses the past 2 semesters, and I am currently a GTA for COSC202. 
I really like machine learning and data analysis, so I am hoping this course will give me the oppurtunity to explore that in the context of digital archaeology. 
Outside of my coursework, I've been in the UT fencing club for the past 4 years.
