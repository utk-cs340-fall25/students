My name is David Wilkey. I go by my middle name, Tanner. I am a senior undergraduate student and will be graduating this December. I am hoping to learn more about how
to properly leverage data to drive important decisions for all types of businesses. A few areas of interest I have as they pertain to this course include finance, energy/utilities,
or possibly something healthcare related. Outside of school, I enjoy travelling, outdoor recreation, exercising, video games, and cooking.
