Hi! My name is Eric Yang, a senior studying Computer Science and I'm into art, writing, and reading! 
For this class, I'm interested in analyzing data related to those topics. Things like book trends,
how social media affects the sale of books, and other whimsical statistics related
to those topics! I also would love to investigate data relating to literary texts as a whole,
i.e scraping the web for certain literary themes and then analyzing how those themes changed
over time. While I'm not too entirely sure the scope of the class, I would love to learn
along the way, and I'm excited to be working with the wide net of data!
