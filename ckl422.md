Nashville is my hometown and I've been at UTK for 3 years, my 1st year at UTK I was a bio major, switched into cs my 2nd year. 
I have been into computers since always having to upgrade my desktop at 14.
Currently I am working for a small computer vision / image processing company here in Knoxville.

Big fan of C/C++, Qt, and image processing

### Hobbies include:
* Judo ([here at UT!](https://volweb.utk.edu/~utmaclub/) always looking for more people)
* Gaming (playing lots of marvel rivals)
* Watching movies/tv (in the middle of The Walking Dead)
