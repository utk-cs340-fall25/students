I am Braeden Watkins, and I am a senior majoring in computer science, with plans to pursue a master's after completing my bachelor's degree.
I grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee, and have lived here all of my life. My original interest in computer science stemmed from a coding class
in high school, and I have enjoyed learning about the field ever since. Numbers and data have always been an interest of mine ever since
I was a kid, so I look forward to diving deeper into data collection and cleaning this semester. In addition to all of this, sports have always
been a great passion of mine, so doing a project revolving around sports would be quite enjoyable.
